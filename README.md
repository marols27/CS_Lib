# CS_Lib

Hello, this is just a way to store code examples and programs that i created during my batchelors degree.
It's supposed to be a plase to store the code so i can use it later or showcase it if i should ever need to.
If you find some way to use my code, remember that the codes are ment to just be a scool assesment. 
So the program might do unexpected things.
I have tried to make my codes as general as possible, to make i usable in most situation. 
But you are using it at your own risk.

Also, if you are using any of my code, remember to reffer to the MIT Licence that you can find at the top level in the repository.
